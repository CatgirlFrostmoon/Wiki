## tab: Basic info

### Names

For general entry instructions regarding fields "Original language", "Primary name", "Non-English", "Romanized", "English", "Aliases":

- [Entry names and aliases](/docs/other-guidelines/entry-names-and-aliases)

#### Album entry -specific name instructions

Include the full album name, even if the name seems to have **multiple parts**:
[#VOCALOID CAFETERIA vol.01 Chinese food](https://vocadb.net/Al/33074) for example.

If the album is split to multiple entries (tracklists differences), try to include this information in the title as well "(Regular Edition)" or "(Kagamine Rin version)", if appropriate. These album entries should then be **linked together** by using the album description and/or external links.

### Cover picture

A cover picture for the album.

- If the album has no cover picture, use the [no cover art -tag.](https://vocadb.net/T/2811/no-cover-art)

- If the only available cover picture is low quality, use the [temporary cover art -tag.](https://vocadb.net/T/429/temporary-cover-art)

### Album description

For other information that does not belong to any other field.

[GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github) is supported for formatting.

English translation can be added/moved to a separate field below, if the original description exists in a non-English language.

### Record type

If unsure of which type to use, try to find out how the artists themselves call the album. For more elaborate descriptions, please refer to Wikipedia, Discogs or Musicbrainz.

- Finished = The entry has all the necessary information, but it hasn't been inspected by a trusted user yet.

Finished album entries should meet the following criteria:

- The album has at least one name and the original language can't be "Unspecified". (ALV2)
- All artists (including vocalists) responsible for the album are specified. Whenever it makes sense, each of those artists should also have an artist entry. (partially ALV3)
- Album has a cover picture (or [temporary cover art -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/429) or [no cover art -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/2811/no-cover-art)). (ALV4)

#### Criteria for approving albums

TODO

## tab: Artists

In this tab, you can add and delete artists that have participated in the album. These changes do not affect the tracklist (song entries).

Vocaloids, UTAUs and other singing synthesizer voicebanks are added as artists as well: [Choosing the correct voicebank credit](/docs/other-guidelines/choosing-the-correct-voicebank-credit)

You can also add an artist to the album by creating a **custom artist**, which adds an artist credit to the album entry as a text (no artist entry is created).

If the album has no known artist credits available, use the [entry missing artists -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/2808/entry-missing-artists).

If the vocalist is uncredited, the artist entry [Unknown vocalist(s)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/23554) can be used. The entry [Unknown vocal synth(s)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/128519) or any of its derived artist entries can also be used to further narrow down the vocalist.

### Support status

For albums, the support status is intended to indicate that an artist had a minor role on compared to other artists **of the same category**. Usually this is the case when the album has multiple songs by one artists and 1 or 2 remixes by a handful of other artists. In this case, the remix artists should be marked as support, because the artist who produced the most songs is clearly the main artist.

Support status has a number of effects: 
* Artists with the support status never appear in the "artist string" of the album. 
* On the album entry page, support artists are shown in parenthesis, and after all the other artists.
* Albums or songs where the artist has support status never appear on the first tab of artist's entry page, under recent or popular albums.
* These albums also never appear on the artist's "main albums" tab.

For collaboration albums, none of the artists can be marked as support, because otherwise all of them would be marked a such.

### Artist roles

Same rules as with songs: [wiki/89/song-entry-editing#Artist-roles](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#Artist-roles).

## tab: Discs

If the album contains multiple discs you may define extra properties for those discs here. You may specify disc **name** and **type** (Audio or Video). Name is optional: if not specified, the default "Disc #" will be used, where "#" is the disc number.

## tab: Tracks

Songs entries can be connected to the album entry here.

Clicking a track by its name opens the "Track properties" -window, which can be used to add artists to the song entry (track). Only the artists which are added in the ["Artists"-tab](/docs/albums/album-entry-editing#tab-Artists) are visible here.

    * If the artist participates in most of the songs, it's efficient to select all the tracks and update them instead of adding the artist to the tracks one by one.

The "custom track" -feature (no song entry) is intended for tracks made by out-of-scope artists. [Secret Sky 2020 (DJ Mix)](https://vocadb.net/Al/32323) for example.

When the album entry is saved, the new tracks are created as song entries.

## tab: Additional pictures

Note that the main picture is edited on the "Basic Info" tab. Only upload pictures relevant to this album.

## tab: Media

Crossfades and other advertisements related to the album.

- [Media (video) services supported by VocaDB](/docs/other-guidelines/supported-streaming-services)

## Update notes

Entry update notes are optional, but should **always** be used if the edit reason or the information source is not obvious.

In some cases, the entry description or the comment section might be more suitable to use.
