## tab: Basic info

### Names

For general entry instructions regarding fields "Original language", "Primary name", "Non-English", "Romanized", "English", "Aliases":

- [Entry names and aliases](/docs/other guidelines/entry-names-and-aliases)

#### Album entry -specific name instructions

Include the full album name, even if the name seems to have multiple parts:
[#VOCALOID CAFETERIA vol.01 Chinese food](https://vocadb.net/Al/33074) for example.

If the album is split to multiple entries (tracklists differences), try to include this information in the title as well "(Regular Edition)" or "Kagamine Rin version)". These album entries should then be linked together using album description and/or external links.

### Cover picture

A cover picture for the album.

- If the album has no cover picture, use the [no cover art -tag.](https://vocadb.net/T/2811/no-cover-art)

- If the only available cover picture is in very low quality, use the [temporary cover art -tag.](https://vocadb.net/T/429/temporary-cover-art)

### Album description

For general entry description and/or various other details that do not belong to any other fields.

[GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github) is supported for formatting.

English translation can be added/moved to a separate field below, if the original description exists in a non-English language.

### Record type

Use common sense when determining the album type (record type). For example, an album with a single song that by itself is as long as a regular album (the definition on Wikipedia says over 25 minutes) can be counted as "original album" instead of single. If unsure of which type to use, try to find out how the artists themselves call the album. For more elaborate descriptions, please refer to Wikipedia, Discogs or Musicbrainz.

More on the page [Album types and artist participation](/docs/albums/album-types-and-artist-participation).

#### Original album

Album that consists mostly of previously unpublished songs.

#### Single

Contains one or two individual tracks. Alternate versions (instrumentals and remixes) are usually not counted.

#### EP

Meaning extended play. Contains 3-4 individual tracks. Alternate versions (instrumentals and remixes) are usually not counted.

#### Split album

Collaboration between two or more (but usually just two) equal artists, where all artists have roughly the same number of songs.

#### Compilation

Collection of previously published songs, gathered from one or more earlier albums. For example, "best of" collections.

#### Video

Disc containing mostly music videos, usually a DVD or Blu-ray.

#### Other

For albums that don't fit into anything above.

### Release event

The first [release event](/docs/secondary entry types/events) that the album was released in.

### Release date

The earliest release date of the album.

### Catalog number

A catalog number typically in a format "ABCD-1234"

"Most releases that aren't self-released have a quasi-unique catalog number, assigned to them by the record label releasing them. Generally, this number will include alphanumeric characters, often letters followed by numbers, perhaps separated by a dash, space or other punctuation."

- definition from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Release/Catalog_Number)

### Barcode

Barcodes are usually plain numbers, for example 01234567. They can be scanned from the product package.

#### Criteria for approving albums

-

## tab: Artists

In this tab, you can add and delete artists that have participated in the album.

Vocaloids, UTAUs and other singing synthesizer voicebanks are added as artists as well: [Choosing the correct voicebank credit](/docs/other guidelines/choosing-the-correct-voicebank-credit)

You can also add an artist to the album by creating a **custom artist**, which adds an artist credit to the album entry as a text (no artist entry is created).

If the album has no known artists credits available: use the [entry missing artists -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/2808/entry-missing-artists).

If the vocalist is uncredited, the artist entry [Unknown vocalist(s)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/23554) can be used. The entry [Unknown vocal synth(s)](https://vocadb.net/Ar/128519) or any of its derived artist entries can also be used to further narrow down the vocalist.

### Support status

Support status is a special setting for a particular artist credit. The support status should be used when the song or album has a clear separation of main artists and support artists.

Usage examples (albums & songs):

- Backing vocals, for example singing chorus when the main vocals are sung by another vocalist.
- Background illustrators (to distinguish them from the main illustrator)
- Guest artists on albums. An artist might invite other guest artists to produce remixes, released together with the original songs. Those guest artists should be marked as support.
  ** For example, album [electroll by 8#Prince](http://vocadb.net/Al/3572)
  ** The same applies if the album is titled for example "feat. Hatsune Miku" and there's 1 or 2 songs with other Vocaloids: those supporting Vocaloids should be marked support.

Support status removes the artist(s) from the artist string (the one that says "producers feat. vocalists). The search is affected as well through the "Only main songs" -filter (also with albums).

### Artist roles

Same rules as with the songs: [wiki/89/song-entry-editing#Artist-roles](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#Artist-roles)

## tab: Discs

If the album contains multiple discs you may define extra properties for those discs here. You may specify disc name and type (Audio or Video). Name is optional - if not specified, the default "Disc #" will be used, where "#" is the disc number.

## tab: Tracks

Songs entries can be linked to the album using this tab.

New song entries can also be directly created from here.

Clicking a track by its name opens the "Track properties" -window, which can be used to add artists to the song (track) entry. Only the artists which are added in the ["Artists"-tab](/docs/albums/album-entry-editing#tab-Artists) are visible.

If the artist participates in most of the songs, it's efficient to select all of the tracks first instead of adding the artist to the tracks one by one.

The new tracks are created as song entries and the track artists get updated when the album entry is saved.

## tab: Additional pictures

Note that the main picture is edited on the "Basic Info" tab. Please only upload pictures relevant to this album, nothing else.

## tab: Media

You can use this page to add advertisements or crossfades related to this album.

- [Media (video) services supported by VocaDB](/docs/other guidelines/supported-streaming-services)

## Update notes

Entry update notes are optional, but should **always** be used if the edit reason or the information source is not obvious.

In some cases, the entry description or the comment section might be more suitable to use.
