Make sure that the content you're about to add belongs to VocaDB:  [content policy](/docs/guidelines/content-policy#songs).

Make sure to read the **automatic infoboxes** and **edit warnings** for potential edit mistakes. 

**Do NOT romanize or translate titles if you do not know the language well enough. Machine translations are strictly forbidden**. It's better to leave the fields empty than have it incorrect.

Entries created should look roughly similiar to those created by trusted users.

Reading the [guidelines](https://vocadb.net/Help/guidelines) gives enough information for most cases.

For more indepth cases and field-specific details, you can consult the **corresponding wiki pages**. For example if you want help with adding albums, check out the wiki page for [albums](/docs/albums/album-entry-editing).

If you're unsure about something, **leave a comment** or an edit note.
