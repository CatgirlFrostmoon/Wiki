## Available user actions

[The song entry status](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/89/song-entry-editing#Status) is shown with an icon on this line.

### Like

Rating a song adds it to your song collection (rated songs): https://vocadb.net/Profile/{username}/songs

The song entry page statistics for "favorite(s) and like(s)" will include your username, unless the the "Allow everyone to see my song and album ratings." -setting is disabled. All of the ratings will stay visible for moderators, and for anyone who visits your rated songs through your profile page.

//Liking// a song increases its score by 2.

#### Featured

Trusted users can add new songs to the [featured songlists](https://vocadb.net/SongList/Featured?categoryName=Pools)

### View modifications

The "View modifications" -button opens the version history for the song entry:
https://vocadb.net/Song/Versions/{artist_id}

The version history table uses 5 columns: //Version//, //Created//, //Author//, //Changes//, //Notes//.

The specific version can be viewed when clicking one of the version numbers in the Version-column:

https://vocadb.net/Song/ViewVersion/{version_id}

The version page has two user actions available (four for [moderators](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/27/user-groups)).

For songs, five report types are available. The notes -field is required for report types 1, 2 & 5.

#### 1. Broken PV

Used for reporting deleted or privated PVs.

This report type communicates that a PV needs to be marked as //Unavailable// or deleted if the link type is "Reprint" or "Other". If possible, prefer doing it yourself instead of creating an entry report.

Keep in mind that if the PV is [region blocked](https://vocadb.net/T/8226/region-blocked), it should not be marked as unavailable.

#### 2. Invalid or missing information

Used for reporting 
*invalid or incorrect information
**Always provide reasoning and proofs unless already obvious.
*missing information
**A missing artist credit for example. If possible, always prefer adding the information yourself instead of leaving a report.

#### 3. Duplicate entry
