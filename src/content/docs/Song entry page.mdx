This page explains the fields and features for the song entry page.

_Rollin' Girl by wowaka_ for example: https://vocadb.net/S/1501

## Available user actions

[The song entry status](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing#Status) is shown with an icon on this line.

### Like

Rating a song adds it to your song collection (rated songs): https://vocadb.net/Profile/\{username\}/songs

The song entry page statistics for "favorite(s) and like(s)" will include your username, unless the the "Allow everyone to see my song and album ratings." -setting is disabled. All of the ratings will stay visible for moderators, and for anyone who visits your rated songs through your profile page.

_Liking_ a song increases its score by 2.

### Favorite

_Favoriting_ a song increases its score by 3.

### Add to custom list

The song can be added to a new or existing song list with this button.

#### Personal lists

All of the custom lists by the user are displayed: https://vocadb.net/Profile/\{username\}/lists

The "description" -field refers to the song list song notes, not the song list description.

#### Featured

Trusted users can add new songs to the [featured songlists](https://vocadb.net/SongList/Featured?categoryName=Pools)

#### New list

_New list name_ can safely be a duplicate, since song lists are saved by song list ids.

### Edit

The "Edit" -button opens [the edit-page](/docs/songs/song-entry-editing) for the song entry.

### View modifications

The "View modifications" -button opens the version history for the song entry:
https://vocadb.net/Song/Versions/\{artist_id\}

The version history table uses 5 columns: _Version_, _Created_, _Author_, _Changes_, _Notes//.

The specific version can be viewed when clicking one of the version numbers in the Version-column:

https://vocadb.net/Song/ViewVersion/\{version_id\}

The version page has two user actions available (four for [moderators](/docs/documentation/user-groups)).

#### Revert to this version (moderators)

- Reverts the song entry to this version. Used for countering vandalism and fixing edit mistakes.

#### Download XML

- Downloads the version information in [XML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).

#### Report an error

- Reports the specific entry version. Using this, a notification will be sent to the relevant editor.

#### Hide this version (moderators)

- Hides the specific entry version. The version link will still be visible on the entry history -page, but the link will be inaccessible to users that are not moderators.

### Report an error

Creates an [entry report](/docs/guidelines/entry-reports) and adds it to the [entry report -list](https://vocadb.net/Admin/ViewEntryReports) that is visible to trusted users and above.

For songs, five report types are available. The notes -field is required for report types 1, 2 & 5.

#### 1. Broken PV

Used for reporting deleted or privated PVs.

This report type communicates that a PV needs to be marked as _Unavailable_ or deleted if the link type is "Reprint" or "Other". If possible, prefer doing it yourself instead of creating an entry report.

Keep in mind that if the PV is [region blocked](https://vocadb.net/T/8226/region-blocked), it should not be marked as unavailable.

#### 2. Invalid or missing information

Used for reporting
*invalid or incorrect information
\*\*Always provide reasoning and proofs unless already obvious.
*missing information
\*\*A missing artist credit for example. If possible, always prefer adding the information yourself instead of leaving a report.

#### 3. Duplicate entry

Song entry is a duplicate and should be [merged](/docs/other-guidelines/merging-entries). A link to the duplicate song entry is required along with proof.

#### 4. Inappropriate content

For song entries that [do not belong to VocaDB](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy#Songs).

#### 5. Other (specify in notes)

### Maintenance actions

These are available only to the moderators.
