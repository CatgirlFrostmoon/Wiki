This page explains how song entries are created. 

Songs are created through the song entry creation -page: https://vocadb.net/Song/Create

If you're unsure if the song should be added in the first place, please read the [content policy for songs](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/59#Songs).

Minimum song entry creation requirements:

* [Name](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/89/Songs#tab-Basic-info)
* 1 [Artist](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/89/Songs#tab-Artists)

These are **different** from the [finished song entry requirements](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/89/song-entry-editing#Finished-song-entry-requirements). 

If the artist entry page doesn't already exist, you will need to use the ["Add an artist" page](https://vocadb.net/Artist/Create) to create an entry. You can also do this after the song has been created, as long as the song entry has some other artist added (some voice synth for example).

After submitting the song, you can add more detailed information to the entry on the [song edit page](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/89/Song-entry-editing). Some of the information is automatically filled based on the PV links (publish date for example).
