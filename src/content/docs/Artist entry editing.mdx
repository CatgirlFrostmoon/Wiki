## tab: Basic info

### Names

For general entry instructions regarding fields "Original language", "Primary name", "Non-English", "Romanized", "English", "Aliases":

* [Entry names and aliases](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/81/entry-names-and-aliases)

#### Artist entry -specific name instructions

Real-life names should not be added as aliases, if they're not used by other artists/sources. Real-life names can still be added, if that's the main artist name.

When artists collaborate, it's common to see artists credited with additional [honorifics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_honorifics). These should be emitted on VocaDB, unless the artist uses those when referring to themselves: [Gedou-san](https://vocadb.net/Ar/1823) for example.

If the artist name is not available, the [anonymous artist -tag](https://vocadb.net/T/6403/anonymous-artist) can be used along with some placeholder name.

Generally (with some exceptions), there is no need to add composite names, and those names should be broken into separate fields:

* "cosMo@Bousou-P(暴走P)" is incorrect: every field should contain only one name.

If there is no separate entry for the artist's solo circle, the circle name can be included as an alias for that artist. In that case, it would be advisable to mention this in the description/notes.

### Main picture

Source 1: [https://vocadb.net/Help/guidelines](https://vocadb.net/Help/guidelines):

When adding pictures to artists, keep in mind all the pictures should be related to the artist himself, not his works. Do not upload album covers for artist entries.

That said, there is no common rule for choosing the main picture of an artist. Photos of the artist himself as well as official logos are preferred. You may upload any number of these pictures as additional pictures for the artist, provided that they're relevant enough. Copyrighted pictures or pictures of artists may be taken down if the copyright holder requests it.

If no better picture is provided, any picture found on one of the artist's official profiles, for example on Twitter, is acceptable as well.

Watch out for pictures that look like avatars but are actually part of the default avatar collection for the website. These should not be added. (TODO list of default avatars per site)

### Artist description

For general entry description and/or various other details that do not belong to any other fields.

[GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github) is supported for formatting.

English translation can be added/moved to a separate field below, if the original description exists in a non-English language.

### Artist type

Artist type specifies the //most common// role that the artist participates in. Additional roles can be specified with [tags](https://vocadb.net/T/7372/artists).

Be careful when changing artist's type when that artist already has songs/albums added. If you do this, generally you need to make sure that artist's roles are still correct, because **changing the type changes the default role for all those existing entries.**

Different artist types are described at [Artist types](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/23/artist-types).

### Associated artists

These fields are available for voicebanks and are displayed when a suitable artist type is selected.

These are inherited to any derived voicebank and can be overwritten where needed.

Multiple associated artists can be added with the same role (multiple illustrators for example).

#### Illustrator
* Illustrator of the official character/voicebank art.

#### Character designer
* Only needs to be specified if it's different from the illustrator.

#### Manager
* Manager of the character/voicebank.

#### Voice provider
* Only needs to be specified if it's different from the voice provider.

### Groups and circles
For grouping related artists under a shared group/circle.

If an artist leaves a group/circle, generally it's best to mention this in the artist & circle description instead of emptying this field.

Solo circles can be added as artist aliases (with explanations in the entry description or edit notes) instead creating a separate entry.

### Base voicebank

Base voicebank if available.

For example, the base voicebank for [Megpoid Talk](https://vocadb.net/Ar/21629) is [GUMI](https://vocadb.net/Ar/3).

Derived voicebank listings are generated automatically.

### Voicebank release date

The release date of the voicebank.

### External links
