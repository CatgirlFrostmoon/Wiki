This page explains how album entries are created.

Albums are created through the album entry creation -page: https://vocadb.net/Album/Create

If you're unsure if the album should be added in the first place, please read the [content policy for albums](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/59/content-policy#Albums).

Minimum album entry creation requirements:

- [Name](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/86/album-entry-editing#tab-Basic-info)
- 1 [Artist](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/86/album-entry-editing#Artists)

These are **different** from the [finished album entry requirements](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/86/album-entry-editing#Finished-album-entry-requirements).

If the artist entry page doesn't already exist, you will need to use the ["Add an artist" page](https://vocadb.net/Artist/Create) to create an entry. You can also do this after the album has been created, as long as the album entry has some other artist added (some voice synth for example).

After submitting the album, you can add more detailed information to the entry on the [album edit page](Album entry editing).
