## Songs

### Are instrumental/human-sung songs allowed on VocaDB?

Generally no, with some exceptions:
* The song was published together on an album with Vocaloid (or other voice synth) songs.
* The song has multiple Vocaloid covers on VocaDB, and it's not already on UtaiteDB/TouhouDB.
    * Add the [out of scope tag](https://vocadb.net/T/6751/out-of-scope-cover-unifier).

Documented on [Content policy/Songs](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy#Songs).

### Should original artist be added to cover/remix?

Generally no, with some exceptions:
* The original artist directly worked with the derived version (cover/remix).
* The original song is out of scope (with human vocals or instrumental) and not on VocaDB. 
    * Also see above: if the out-of-scope song is added to VocaDB, then original artist should not be added to derivatives.

Rationale: if the original song is on VocaDB, repeating the original artists for derivatives is redundant, and redundant information should be avoided.

### If a Vocaloid song was released simultaneously with a human vocals version, which one is the original?

On VocaDB we give preference to the Vocaloid version, unless the artist clearly indicated that the version with human vocals should be original.

### I think that the song is using an append (or other version than indicated), but can't confirm. Which voicebank should I use?

In general you should use the voicebank indicated by the artist. If you have a strong reason to believe that the voicebank is an append or other variation, such as Vocaloid 3 upgrade of the voicebank, you can use that knowledge to use that voicebank instead, but please mention that in the edit notes, song notes or comments.

Rationale: all information on VocaDB should be verifiable, meaning there's a clear way to confirm it by checking the official source.

Documented on [Choosing the correct voicebank credit](/docs/other-guidelines/choosing-the-correct-voicebank-credit) -page.

### Are work in progress versions of songs allowed on VocaDB?

Generally no. Work in progress (WIP) songs should not be added on VocaDB, except in special cases. Demo songs for upcoming voicebanks are allowed even if they're not complete, but avoid adding too many of them. All songs on VocaDB should either be publicly available for streaming, or published on an album.

It's ok to add an entry for a song that isn't released yet if you know when and where it will be released. In this case, input the planned release date and mention in the song notes where the song will be released.

Documented on [Content policy/Songs](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy#Songs).

### What is the publish date of a song?

Publish date (release date) is the date when the song was first made public. This includes: 
* Video streaming services such as NicoNicoDouga and YouTube.
* Distributing the song on a physical album at a record store or event.
* Digital album on a marketplace such as iTunes. 

The publish date on VocaDB must be the earliest date one of these happened. Private/friend distribution is not counted. Work in progress versions also do not count.

If the song is deleted and then reuploaded, the publish date does not change. It's still the date when the song was first made public.

## Albums

### If an album was released as multiple editions (such as regular/limited), is there need to create separate entries?

Generally no, unless the tracklists are different or the editions were released at different times. Additional discs, different cover and catalog number are allowed without the need to create separate entry.

However, the differences between different editions (especially additional discs) should be clearly explained in the album description.

For album entries with multiple editions (either as single entry or multiple entries), apply the [multiple editions](http://vocadb.net/T/4877/multiple-editions) tag.

#### Reasons for splitting the album into multiple entries

(applies if one of these is true)

* Changing the order of tracks (this prevents automatic tagging)
* Adding or removing tracks **from the middle** (not just end)
* Significantly changing the contents of the tracks (remix/cover/different lengths). Small changes do not require splitting.

#### Reasons for not splitting the album

* Appending something to the name (such as "Limited Edition")
* Different covers (additional covers can be added on the "Additional pictures" tab)
* Adding or removing discs (usually DVD/video)
* Adding or removing tracks **from the end**
* Different catalog numbers (additional catalog numbers can be mentioned in the catalog number field)

Rationale: albums with multiple editions are more of a rule than exception, and splitting the editions into multiple entries provides little additional value.

### Should I create an album entry for a song?

Albums entries "Singles" can be created, if appropriate: album has a cover art and other album-specific properties.

## Artists

### Should a Vocaloid with multiple voicebanks be split into multiple entries?

As a rule of thumb, Vocaloid artist entries on VocaDB should match the voicebanks available in the Vocaloid editor: if they appear separate in the editor then they should probably be separate entries on VocaDB, but this isn't always the case. If the voicebanks are distributed separately (possibly released at different times), then that is a good reason for splitting the voicebanks into different entries as well.

Appends/variations such as [Miku V4X Dark](http://vocadb.net/Ar/50233) and [Miku V4X Solid](http://vocadb.net/Ar/50235) are separate entries. However, [EVEC](http://vocadb.net/T/4828/evec) voice colors such as Miku V4X Soft EVEC are not separate entries, because they're not considered separate voicebanks. Instead, voice colors are tracked by tags when necessary.

Sometimes the Vocaloid might have multiple voicebanks but they're almost always credited as one. For example [ONE](http://vocadb.net/Ar/31062), who has talking and singing voicebanks. In this case, for practical purposes to make crediting the voicebanks easier, there only needs to be one entry on VocaDB. That voicebank entry may later be split if necessary.

In general, if unsure, the safest way is to start with one entry and split that later if necessary. We want to avoid ending up with multiple unused Vocaloid entries.

Note about UTAU voicebanks: because UTAUs often have so many voicebanks/appends, we generally don't create separate entries for those appends, except for those that are exceptionally popular and commonly credited as separate.

#### Reasons for splitting voicebank entries

* Voicebanks are commonly credited as separate by the artists
* Voicebanks appear separate in the Vocaloid editor
* Voicebanks sound distinctly different, or are made for different languages
* Voicebanks have separate brand names / box art
* Voicebanks were released at different times
* Voicebanks can be purchased separately (they are not always bundled together)

Rationale: Artist entries are relatively cheap, but having too many of them makes finding and managing them difficult. We want the voicebank credits to be as accurate as possible, but without complicating the editing unnecessarily. Helping users find the relevant information is the key. Therefore, a balance is needed.
