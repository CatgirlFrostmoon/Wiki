This page explains how artist entries are created.

Artists are created through the artist entry creation -page: https://vocadb.net/Artist/Create

If you're unsure if the artist should be added in the first place, please read the [content policy for artists](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/59/content-policy#Artists).

Minimum entry creation requirements:
* [Name](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/83/artist-entry-editing#tab-Basic-info)
* [Description](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/83/artist-entry-editing#Artist-description) OR [External link](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/83/artist-entry-editing#External-links)

These are the **same** as [finished artist entry requirements](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/83/Artists#Finished-artist-entry-requirements). 

For choosing the artist picture, see [the relevant section](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/83/artist-entry-editing#Main-picture). The picture can also be added on the more detailed [edit-page](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/83/artist-entry-editing), along with other types of data.
