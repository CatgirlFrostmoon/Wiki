This page explains how artist entries are created.

Artists are created through the artist entry creation -page: https://vocadb.net/Artist/Create

If you're unsure if the artist should be added in the first place, please read the [content policy for artists](/docs/other-guidelines/content-policy#Artists).

Minimum entry creation requirements:

- [Name](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing#tab-Basic-info)
- [Description](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing#Artist-description) OR [External link](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing#External-links)

These are the **same** as [finished artist entry requirements](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing#Finished-artist-entry-requirements).

For choosing the artist picture, see [the relevant section](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing#Main-picture). The picture can also be added on the more detailed [edit-page](/docs/artists/artist-entry-editing), along with other types of data.
