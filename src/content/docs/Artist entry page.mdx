This page explains the artist entry page features.

Hatsune Miku for example: https://vocadb.net/Ar/1

This page displays the entry data and provides some of the website features through user actions.

## Available user actions

[The artist entry status](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/83/artist-entry-editing#Status) is shown with an icon on this line.

### Follow

Artist entries can be //followed// to show support and get notified when artists release new songs or albums or participate in events.

There are three artist-specific notification settings:

- No notifications.
- Notify me on-site.
- Notify me both on-site and by email.

Follower lists for artists are not available, but followed artists for users are available at https://vocadb.net/Profile/\{username\}/artists

### Edit

The "Edit" -button opens [the edit-page](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/83/artist-entry-editing#Artist-entry-editing) for the artist entry.

### View modifications

The "View modifications" -button opens the version history for the artist entry:
https://vocadb.net/Artist/Versions/\{artist_id\}

The version history table uses 5 columns: //Version//, //Created//, //Author//, //Changes//, //Notes//.

The specific version can be viewed when clicking one of the version numbers in the Version-column:

https://vocadb.net/Artist/ViewVersion/\{version_id\}

The version page has two user actions available (four for [moderators](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/27/user-groups)).

#### Revert to this version (moderators)

- Reverts the artist entry to this version. Used for countering vandalism and fixing edit mistakes.

#### Download XML

- Downloads the version information in [XML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).

#### Report an error

- Reports the specific entry version. Using this, a notification will be sent to the relevant editor.

#### Hide this version (moderators)

- Hides the specific entry version. The version link will still be visible on the entry history -page, but the link will be inaccessible to users that are not moderators.

### Report an error

Creates an [entry report](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/58/entry-reports) and adds it to the [entry report -list](https://vocadb.net/Admin/ViewEntryReports) that is visible to trusted users+

For artists, four report types are available. The notes -field is required for report types 1 & 4.

#### 1. Invalid or missing information

Used for reporting
*invalid or incorrect information
\*\*Always provide reasoning and proofs unless already obvious.
*missing information
\*\*A missing alias or a circle for example. If possible, always prefer adding the information yourself instead of leaving a report. Avoid requesting entries (such as missing albums/songs) through entry reports.

#### 2. Duplicate entry

Artist entry is a duplicate and should be [merged](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/46/merging-entries). A link to the duplicate artist entry is required along with proof.

#### 3. Inappropriate content

For artists entries that [do not belong to VocaDB](https://wiki.vocadb.net/wiki/59/content-policy#Artists).
